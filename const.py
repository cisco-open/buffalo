The sudden increase in cost caused by supply disruptions of these oil price shocks resulted in a change in consumer behavior and an overall price increase across the oil consuming economy. These price increases lead to a reduction in the consumption of oil which cause a reduction in the supply of oil supply and creates a negative economic feedback loop."
